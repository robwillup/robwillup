## More of a Took than a Baggins

> "Tooks were mainly of Fallohide Hobbit stock, and were **more adventurous** than the other Hobbits."

From the LOTR universe, I would consider my software developer profile to resemble the traits of the *Tooks*: Courageous and eager for new adventures and challenges!

## Skills

Ok, enough tales for now, here's the list of my current skills (stuff I'm confident I can do well):

### Languages

 **.NET**
 
I'm doing .NET since college and I just love it more and more. Specially after ... of course, **.NET Core**!!! I have been writing all sorts of apps with .NET including, but not limited to: ASP.NET Core web APIs and web apps, Blazor, Desktop WPF and Windows Forms, Console and CLI apps, Worker Service, gRPC, xUnit.
  
 **Go**

I started playing with Golang about a year ago and now I just have to use it wherever I *go*! (yeah, sorry, couldn't help it). Some of the applications and projects I've created include: CLI apps, web APIs, unit tests, CI/CD tooling.

### Platforms

These are some of  the platforms and tools I've been working with: Azure, AKS, App Service, Azure Functions, CosmosDB, Azure DevOps, App Center, Docker, Linux, Windows.

I am a certified Azure developer:

## Learning

And here's a list of things I'm actively learning at this moment:

* Rust
* Elixir
* Kubernetes

## Interests 

If I had to name only a few of the things I'm most interested in I would say `Microservices,`, `gRPC`, `IoT`, and `Machine Learning`. 

## What the future holds

I plan to keep my GitHub profile and repositories up to date. I hope we have a chance to work together on some interesting project.

See you!
