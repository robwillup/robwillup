## Who am I?

### More of a Took than a Baggins

> "Tooks were mainly of Fallohide Hobbit stock, and were **more adventurous** than the other Hobbits."

> -- <cite>J.R.R. Tolkien</cite>

From the LOTR universe, I would consider my software developer profile to resemble the traits of the *Tooks*: Eager for new adventures and challenges!

## Skills

Here's the list of my current skills:

### Languages

 **.NET**
 
I've been learning and working with .NET for more than 6 years and I just enjoy it more every year. Specially after ... of course, **.NET Core**! I have been writing all sorts of apps with .NET including, but not limited to: ASP.NET Core web APIs and web apps, Blazor, Desktop WPF and Windows Forms, Console and CLI apps, Worker Service, gRPC, xUnit.
  
 **Go**

I started playing with Golang about two years ago and now I am always trying to find new opportunities to use it. Some of the applications and projects I've created include: CLI apps, web APIs, unit tests, CI/CD tooling.

### Platforms

These are some of the platforms and tools I've been working with: Azure, AKS, App Service, Azure Functions, CosmosDB, Azure DevOps, App Center, Docker, Linux, Windows.

I am a certified Azure developer:
