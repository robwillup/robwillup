## Skills

Here's the list of my current skills:

### Languages

 **.NET**

I've been learning and working with .NET for more than 6 years and I just enjoy it more every year. Specially after ... of course, **.NET Core**! I have been writing all sorts of apps with .NET including, but not limited to: ASP.NET Core web APIs and web apps, Blazor, Desktop WPF and Windows Forms, Console and CLI apps, Worker Service, gRPC, xUnit.

 **Go**

I started playing with Golang about two years ago and now I am always trying to find new opportunities to use it. Some of the applications and projects I've created include: CLI apps, web APIs, unit tests, CI/CD tooling.

### Platforms

These are some of the platforms and tools I've been working with: Azure, AKS, App Service, Azure Functions, CosmosDB, Azure DevOps, App Center, Docker, Linux, Windows.

I am a certified Azure developer:

</p>

At work I have also contributed to projects in different programming languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular, Node.js, Java, Spring Boot, and a little bit of Python and C++. As for databases, I have mainly worked with Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgresSQL, Cosmos DB / MongoDB.
