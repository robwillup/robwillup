  Hi, I'm Rob 👋
</h1>

I'm a software engineer 🧑🏻‍💻 who specializes in backend and desktop
development 🚀.

I also enjoy working with hardware projects 🤖 involving Raspberry Pi, Arduino and
my soldering station 💥.

### .NET

I've been learning and working with .NET for more than 6 years and I just enjoy
it more every year. Specially after ... of course, **.NET Core**! I have been
writing all sorts of apps with .NET including ASP.NET Core web APIs and web apps,
Blazor, Desktop WPF and Windows Forms, Console and CLI apps, Worker Service, gRPC,
xUnit.

### Go

I started playing with Golang about two years ago and now I am always trying to find
new opportunities to use it. Some of the applications and projects I've created
include: CLI apps, web APIs, unit tests, CI/CD tooling.

### Azure

These are some of the platforms and tools I've been working with: Azure, AKS, App
Service, Azure Functions, CosmosDB, Azure DevOps, App Center, Docker, Linux, Windows.

I am a certified Azure developer:

</p>

At work I have also contributed to projects in different programming languages and
frameworks, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular, Node.js, Java, Spring
Boot, and a little bit of Python and C++. As for databases, I have mainly worked
with Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgresSQL, Cosmos DB / MongoDB.

### Other topics

And here's a few other things I don't use for work but like to learn and use in
personal projects as possible:

* Elixir
* Rust
* C
* IoT
